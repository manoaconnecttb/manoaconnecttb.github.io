# Welcome to Manoa Connect

**Manoa Connect** is a centralized platform designed to connect students at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa with the many amazing clubs, student organizations, and communities on campus.

We believe that every student should be able to find a place where they belong—and Club Hub is here to help make that happen.

---

## Deployment

See website: <a href="https://manoa-connect.vercel.app/">Manoa Connect</a>
- ![ci-ManoaConnect](https://github.com/manoaconnecttb/ManoaConnect//workflows/ci-ManoaConnect/badge.svg)

## Overview

Our goal is to build a user-friendly and dynamic platform where:
- Students can explore a wide variety of UH Mānoa clubs based on interests, major, or activity type.
- Clubs can create and manage public profiles to advertise their purpose, events, and meeting times.
- Students can express interest, contact club leaders, and track the clubs they’ve joined.

## What Club Hub Will Provide

When complete, Club Hub will include:
- **Club Directory** with profiles and contact info
- **Search and Filter** system by interest, time commitment, category, and more
- **Club News Feed** with announcements and events
- **Student Dashboards** for managing saved/joined clubs
- **Admin Tools** for club leaders to edit info and post updates
