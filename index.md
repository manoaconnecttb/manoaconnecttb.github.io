# Welcome to Club Hub

**Club Hub** is a centralized platform designed to connect students at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa with the many amazing clubs, student organizations, and communities on campus.

We believe that every student should be able to find a place where they belong—and Club Hub is here to help make that happen.

## Project Goals

Our goal is to build a user-friendly and dynamic platform where:
- Students can explore a wide variety of UH Mānoa clubs based on interests, major, or activity type.
- Clubs can create and manage public profiles to advertise their purpose, events, and meeting times.
- Students can express interest, contact club leaders, and track the clubs they’ve joined.
- Everything is searchable and filterable, from cultural orgs to pre-professional societies to hobby-based clubs.

- **Club Directory** with profiles and contact info
